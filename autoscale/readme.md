### vmss-lap-autoscale.json ###

Simple self-contained Ubuntu/Apache/PHP autoscale & load balancing example. Scale Set scales up when avg CPU across all VMs > 60%, scales down when avg CPU < 50%.

- Deploy the scale set with an instance count of 1
- Browse to the website (port 80), which shows the current backend VM name.
- Hit the "Do work" button with an iteration count of say 600.
- After a few minutes the scale set capacity will increase, and refreshing the browser and going to the home page a few times will show additional VM additional backend VM nane(s).
- You can increase the work by connecting to more backend websites, or decrease by letting the iterations time-out, in which case the scale set will scale down.
