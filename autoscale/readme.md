### Autoscale templates ###

The following templates each deploy a VM Scale Set integrated with Azure autoscale. For officially maintained templates go to <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates">Azure quickstart templates</a>.

### vmss-win-autoscale.json ###

Deploy a simple Windows based scale set.

How to use:
- Deploy with an instance count of 1.
- RDP into port 50000 and max the CPU.
- After a few minutes additional VMs will be created.

### vmss-lap-autoscale.json ###

Simple self-contained Ubuntu/Apache/PHP autoscale & load balancing example. Scale Set scales up when avg CPU across all VMs > 60%, scales down when avg CPU < 50%.

- Deploy the scale set with an instance count of 1 
- After it is deployed look at the resource group public IP address resource (in portal or resources explorer). Get the IP or domain name.
- Browse to the website (port 80), which shows the current backend VM name.
- Hit the "Do work" button with an iteration count of say 300 (represents seconds of max CPU).
- After a few minutes the scale set capacity will increase, and refreshing the browser and going to the home page a few times will show additional backend VM name(s).
- You can increase the work by connecting to more backend websites, or decrease by letting the iterations time-out, in which case the scale set will scale down ï¿½ hence after about 10 minutes the capacity should be back down to 1.
